# Quake Mapping Process Journal Model
This is a sample of how to use GitHub as a process journal for a Quake map. This model is inspired by https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma in an effort to demonstrate design process in a level design portfolio piece. 

In addition to documenting design process through GitHub commits, this model uses the [project wiki](https://github.com/dantogno/quake-map/wiki) to showcase various key stages of the production process and provide insight into the designer's problem solving and design thinking.
